# Write a script that takes two files of unique numbers 
#and displays the difference between the two lists (without using grep).
#For example:
#File 1 contains:

#1
#2
#4
#6

#File 2 contains:

#1
#2
#89
#6
#7

$ vim file1.txt

#!/bin/bash

1
2
4
6

$ vim file2.txt

1
2
89
6
7

#The output should look like:

#Only in file 1:
#4

#Only in file 2:
#89
#7

$ cat file1.txt
$ cat file2.txt
$ diff -y file1.txt file2.txt
