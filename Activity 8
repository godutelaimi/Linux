#Create a script that completes the following tasks:

#It prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
#The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
#After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry or enter another number.
#When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
#the product of the integers
#the average of the integers
#the sum of the integers
#the min of the integers
#the max of the integers
#After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
#the values the user entered
#each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value
